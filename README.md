## Directed Study in Business - 38477 - BUSN 7990 - B3

This eight-hour workshop introduces students to the data science workflow using Python. The workshop will cover four topics: The Python language essentials, data transformation, data visualization and modeling. The workshop will cover mainstream Python packages including Pandas, Altair, and Scikit-learn among others. Each topic is covered in one two-hour flipped classroom session. The sessions are centered around data-related problems. Students will work in groups to answer questions and gain understanding of selected data sets. As a workshop project, students will turn in an interactive notebook that presents a comprehensive analysis of a selected data set. The notebook should cover all learned topics including data transformation, visualization and modeling. Extensive preparation prior to every session is required. A basic understanding of statistics and computer programming is required too.

## Texts
There are no books required for this course. The following two free books by [Jake VanderPlas](http://vanderplas.com) are useful:
- [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/): a fast-paced introduction to essential features of the Python language.
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook): a complete coverage for modern Python tools for researchers and data scientists.
  
## Software
Python 3.7 or higher is required. The easy way to install it is with [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Several other packages including Pandas, Altair and Scikit-learn are needed among others. These packages can be downloaded and installed by downloading the [requirements.txt](blob/master/requirements.txt) file in this repo then running the following command:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, the code of this repository can be run online with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hanisaf/python-bootcamp/master). Please note that Binder is a third-party site and there are no guarantees about the service.

Several other companies provide cloud services for running Python notebooks.
